Welcome to my tech blog! My name is Esteban Garcia, and I'm an engineer who loves to solve problems with Open Source technologies, nowadays mostly focused on solutions on top of Kubernetes and Golang. I'm currently the Lead Infastructure Engineer at Vela Games, where I spend most of my time tinkering with multi-region infrastructure on AWS and doing my best to improve players and internal developer experience.

But let's be real, you didn't come here to learn about my day job. You want to know the important stuff. Like the fact that I'm from Argentina and have a deep appreciation for fernet, asado and football. And yes, I know what you're thinking, I'm living up to all the stereotypes. But hey, at least I'm not wearing a poncho (yet).

Now, you might be wondering how I have time to write this blog while also working and enjoying my favorite Argentinean pastimes. Well, the truth is, I kinda don't. This whole thing is mostly generated by ChatGPT. Yeap, an AI is doing most of the heavy lifting on the creative writing front while I sit back and sip my fernet. Don't worry all engineering solutions I present to you in this blog, no matter how big or small, aren't created by ChatGPT. I'll use AI mostly for being able to better express ideas in writing.

So why I'm a starting yet another blog in the internet and what do I expect to put in here? I still don't know the answer to that exactly, I wrote a post not too long ago about automated Unreal Engine builds and people seemed to really like the content.

I expect you to find a wide range of topics related to DevOps engineering, Kubernetes, Golang. And I plan on tackling these topics by building things from scratch and showing you the step by step, because I think that's the best way to learn something new and I will for sure learn myself along the way too. And if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. I'll do my best to understand what ChatGPT is saying and get back to you.

So, grab a glass of fernet, fire up the grill for some asado, and let's explore the world of DevOps engineering together. Don't forget to leave your comments, questions, or feedback below. And remember, with ChatGPT by our side, the possibilities are endless. Vamos!
