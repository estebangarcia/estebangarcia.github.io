Welcome to my tech blog! My name is Esteban Garcia, currently based in Dublin, Iâ€™m an engineer who loves to solve problems with Open Source technologies, nowadays mostly focused on solutions on top of Kubernetes and Golang.

I'm currently the Lead Infastructure Engineer at Vela Games, where I spend most of my time tinkering with multi-region infrastructure on AWS and doing my best to improve players and internal developer experience.

In this blog I expect you to find a wide range of topics related to DevOps engineering, CI/CD, Kubernetes, Golang. And I plan on tackling these topics by building things from scratch and showing you the step by step, because I think that's the best way to learn something new and I will for sure learn myself along the way too.

If you want to know more about me I invite you to go to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esteban-garcia-ba57b325/).
